    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\nQ: Can I extend one of Projects 1-3?\nA: Yes, but the extension must be substantial and clearly beyond the original scope.\nQ: Can I use my research for the capstone?\nA: Yes, with advisor approval and clear statement of your individual contribution.\nQ: What if my project fails?\nA: Negative results are valuable! Document what you tried, why it didn‚Äôt work, and what you learned.\nQ: Can I collaborate with others?\nA: You can discuss ideas, but implementation and writing must be individual. All discussions must be acknowledged.\nQ: How much code is expected?\nA: Quality over quantity. A well-documented, clean implementation of one algorithm is better than messy code for five.",
