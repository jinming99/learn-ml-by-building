Document what you tried, why it didn‚Äôt work, and what you learned.\nQ: Can I collaborate with others?\nA: You can discuss ideas, but implementation and writing must be individual. All discussions must be acknowledged.\nQ: How much code is expected?\nA: Quality over quantity. A well-documented, clean implementation of one algorithm is better than messy code for five.",
