# Practical Machine Learning Course

A comprehensive, hands-on machine learning course using interactive Jupyter notebooks. Build real ML systems while understanding the fundamental principles.

## Course Philosophy

Inspired by fast.ai, our motto is "build first, understand later." We believe the best way to develop a deep intuition for machine learning is to start by building real systems.

**Note on AI in Development:** To model modern and transparent development practices, AI-powered tools were used to assist in the creation of these course materials. All content has been directed, reviewed, and validated by the instructor.
