## Course Description

Algorithms and principles involved in machine learning with applications to various engineering domains; fundamentals of representing uncertainty, learning from data, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and learning theory; design and analysis of machine learning systems; design and implementation of a technical project applied to real-world datasets.

## Course Philosophy

This course embraces a **"Learn ML by Building"** philosophy:

- **Fundamentals First**: Core concepts and unifying principles form the foundation
- **Scaffolded Learning**: Progressive complexity with provided code skeletons
- **AI Portfolio**: Build a collection of projects as mini research papers
- **Practical Impact**: Bridge theory and application through hands-on implementation

## Course Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Analyze and contrast broad classes of machine learning algorithms (supervised vs. unsupervised)
2. Describe and apply fundamental concepts of learning from data (maximum likelihood estimation, maximum a posteriori, overfitting vs underfitting, regularization, cross-validation)
3. Design and implement supervised learning algorithms for regression and classification
4. Apply unsupervised learning algorithms for clustering and dimensionality reduction
5. Build and train neural networks using modern deep learning frameworks
6. Implement basic reinforcement learning agents
7. Evaluate ML systems for performance, fairness, and societal impact
8. Communicate complex ML concepts clearly through written reports and presentations
