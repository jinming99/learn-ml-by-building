## Course Philosophy

This course takes a **hands-on approach** to machine learning. You'll:

- **Build real ML systems**, not just study theory
- **Create an AI portfolio** of mini research papers
- **Explain complex concepts simply** (teaching = understanding)
- **Work with cutting-edge tools** while mastering fundamentals

We believe the best way to understand machine learning is to build it, break it, and rebuild it better.

Our practical, project-first ethos is inspired by the excellent work from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/).
