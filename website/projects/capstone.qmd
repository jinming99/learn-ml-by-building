title: "Capstone Project"
subtitle: "Your Individual ML Research Project"
---

## Overview

The capstone project is your opportunity to conduct independent research in machine learning, applying everything you've learned to a problem you're passionate about. This individual project represents 45% of your course grade and culminates in a conference-style paper and presentation.

## Timeline & Deliverables

| Deliverable | Due Date | Weight | Format |
|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Proposal** | April 11 (Week 13) | 10% of capstone | 1-2 pages |
| **Milestone Report** | April 18 (Week 14) | 20% of capstone | 3-4 pages + code |
| **Spotlight Presentation** | April 21-23 (Week 15) | 10% of capstone | 10 min talk |
| **Final Report** | April 25 (Week 15) | 60% of capstone | 6-8 pages |

## Project Scope

### Good Capstone Projects:
- **Applied ML**: Apply ML to a novel domain or dataset
- **Reproduce & Extend**: Replicate a recent paper and add improvements
- **Comparative Study**: Systematic comparison of methods on new task
- **Tool/Library**: Build a useful ML tool with documentation
- **Theory**: Prove something about an algorithm or propose new method

### Topic Selection Criteria:
- Aligned with course content
- Feasible in 3 weeks
- Has clear evaluation metrics
- Potential for interesting findings
- Relates to your interests/research

## Resources & Support

### Compute Resources
- Google Colab Pro available (request access)
- Virginia Tech ARC clusters for GPU jobs
- Contact instructor for cloud credits if needed

### Datasets
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
- [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets)
- Your own research data (with advisor permission)

### Writing Resources
- [NeurIPS Paper Template](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/PaperInformation/StyleFiles)

## Submission Instructions

### For All Deliverables:
1. Submit PDF via Canvas
2. Include GitHub repository link
3. Use NeurIPS/ICML format for reports
4. Name files: `LastName_Capstone_[Deliverable].pdf`

### Code Repository Must Include:
- README with setup instructions
- Requirements file
- Core implementation
- Example notebook
- Data preprocessing (if applicable)

## FAQ

**Q: Can I extend one of Projects 1-3?**  
A: Yes, but the extension must be substantial and clearly beyond the original scope.

**Q: Can I use my research for the capstone?**  
A: Yes, with advisor approval and clear statement of your individual contribution.

**Q: What if my project fails?**  
A: Negative results are valuable! Document what you tried, why it didn't work, and what you learned.

**Q: Can I collaborate with others?**  
A: You can discuss ideas, but implementation and writing must be individual. All discussions must be acknowledged.

**Q: How much code is expected?**  
A: Quality over quantity. A well-documented, clean implementation of one algorithm is better than messy code for five.

## Past Successful Projects

Examples of A-grade capstones from previous years:

1. **"Predicting Solar Panel Efficiency from Weather Data"** - Applied various models, created useful tool
2. **"Reproducing and Improving BERT for Low-Resource Languages"** - Extended paper with new language
3. **"Comparative Study of RL Algorithms on Custom Game Environment"** - Built environment, tested 5 algorithms
4. **"Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices"** - Novel constraints, practical application
5. **"Fairness Analysis of Admission Algorithms"** - Important social impact, thorough analysis
