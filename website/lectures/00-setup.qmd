## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Click the "Open in Colab" link above
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. You're ready to go! No local installation needed

### Option 2: Local Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jinming99/learn-ml-by-building.git
cd learn-ml-by-building

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv ml-env
source ml-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: ml-env\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Why Environment Setup Matters
- **Reproducibility**: Same code works for everyone
- **Package Management**: Avoid version conflicts
- **Collaboration**: Share code that others can run

### Tools We'll Use Throughout the Course
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Classical ML algorithms
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: Deep learning

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Complete these to ensure your setup is working:

- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] Can run Jupyter notebooks
- [ ] NumPy and Pandas import successfully
- [ ] Can create basic plots with Matplotlib
- [ ] GitHub repository cloned/accessible

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

:::{.callout-warning}
## Troubleshooting
**Import errors?** → Check your virtual environment is activated  
**Jupyter not found?** → Run `pip install jupyter`  
**GPU not available in Colab?** → Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU

## 📝 Pre-Class Preparation

Before next class:
1. Complete environment setup
2. Run through the setup notebook
3. Post any issues on Piazza
