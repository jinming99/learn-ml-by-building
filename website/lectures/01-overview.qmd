subtitle: "Course Introduction & Learning ML Through a Cat's Eyes"

## Overview

Welcome to Machine Learning! This course takes a unique "Learn by Building" approach where you'll implement real ML systems from day one. In today's hands-on session, we'll explore the three fundamental paradigms of machine learning‚Äîsupervised, unsupervised, and active learning‚Äîby building **CatShop**, an e-commerce system that thinks like a cat using Google's Gemma-3 language model.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will:

- **Experience** all three ML paradigms through hands-on implementation
- **Fine-tune** Gemma-3 (270M parameters) using LoRA for efficient adaptation
- **Observe** catastrophic forgetting and model trade-offs
- **Build** a complete ML application from data to deployment
- **Understand** how active learning reduces labeling costs
